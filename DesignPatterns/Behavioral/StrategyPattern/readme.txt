Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. 
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.


Ex: The strategy pattern which encapsulates sorting algorithms in the form of sorting objects.
This allows clients to dynamically change sorting strategies including Quicksort, Shellsort, and Mergesort.
